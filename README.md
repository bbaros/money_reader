# Matt Levine Money Stuff Email Reader

A React application that helps users read Matt Levine's "Money Stuff" emails by providing a two-pane layout with main content on top and footnotes on the bottom, both scrollable independently.

## How to Use

1.  **Paste Email HTML**: Open the application. You will see a text area where you can paste the raw HTML content of a Matt Levine "Money Stuff" email.
2.  **Parse Email**: Click the "Parse Email" button. The application will process the HTML.
3.  **Read with Two-Pane View**: The application will display the email in a two-pane layout:
    *   The main content of the email appears in the top pane.
    *   Footnotes appear in the bottom pane.
    *   Both panes are independently scrollable.
4.  **Interactive Footnotes**: Click on a footnote reference (e.g., `[1]`) in the main content. The corresponding footnote will be automatically scrolled into view and highlighted in the bottom pane.

## Features

*   **Two-Pane Layout**: Displays email content and footnotes in separate, independently scrollable panes for easy reading.
*   **Interactive Footnote System**: Clickable footnote references in the main text navigate directly to the corresponding footnote, which is then highlighted.
*   **HTML Parsing**: Parses raw HTML from Matt Levine's "Money Stuff" emails to extract main content and footnotes.
*   **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes, stacking panes vertically on mobile devices for optimal viewing.
*   **MUI Components**: Utilizes Material-UI for a clean and modern user interface.

## Technology Stack

*   **Frontend**: Vite + React 18 + TypeScript
*   **UI Library**: Material-UI (MUI) v5
*   **Build Tool**: Vite
*   **Package Manager**: npm

## Getting Started / Development

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) must be installed on your system.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/money_reader
    ```
    (Replace `your-username` with the actual username or organization if this is a remote repository. If it's local, you might skip this or adjust.)

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd money_reader
    ```

3.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server and view the application in your browser:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will typically open the application at `http://localhost:5173` (Vite's default) or another port if specified. Check your terminal output for the exact address.

### Building the Application

To create a production build of the application:

```sh
npm run build
```

This command bundles the application and outputs the static files to the `dist` directory. This directory contains everything needed to deploy the application.

### Running as a Static Website

The `dist` directory generated by the build process is a self-contained static website. You can host these files on any static file server or platform.

Here are a couple of ways to serve the `dist` directory locally for testing:

1.  **Using `npx serve` (requires Node.js):**
    If you have Node.js installed, you can use the `serve` package to quickly start a local server.
    ```sh
    npx serve dist
    ```
    This will typically make the application available at `http://localhost:3000` or another port. Check your terminal output for the exact address.

2.  **Opening `dist/index.html` directly in a browser:**
    You can also open the `dist/index.html` file directly in your web browser.
    ```
    file:///path/to/your/project/money_reader/dist/index.html
    ```
    Note: While this works for simple cases, some browser features or routing configurations might not work as expected when opened via the `file://` protocol. Using a local HTTP server (like `npx serve`) is generally recommended for a more accurate testing environment.

The `dist` directory can be uploaded to services like GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, AWS S3, or any other static hosting provider.

**Note for GitHub Pages Deployment:** The `vite.config.ts` is configured with `base: '/money_reader/'` to ensure correct asset loading when deployed to GitHub Pages under a repository named `money_reader`. If deploying to a different path or platform, this configuration might need adjustment.

### Automated Deployment

Deployment to GitHub Pages is automated using GitHub Actions. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/deploy-gh-pages.yml` and triggers on pushes to the `main` branch. This means that any changes merged into the `main` branch will automatically be built and deployed to the live GitHub Pages site.

## Testing

This project includes tests for the email parsing functionality.

### Automated Parser Test

The primary automated test validates the email parsing logic. It checks if footnotes are correctly identified and extracted.

To run this test:
```sh
npm run test:parser
```
This command executes the `tests/test_parser.js` script.

### Manual End-to-End Testing

For manual testing of the user interface and overall application flow:

1.  Start the development server:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
2.  Open the application in your browser.
3.  Use sample email HTML (e.g., from `tests/test_email.html` or the examples in `tests/test_parser.js`) to paste into the input field.
4.  Verify that the email parses correctly, the two-pane layout works as expected, and footnote interactions (clicking, scrolling, highlighting) are functional.

For more detailed testing information, including specific checks and how to use the browser console for tests, please refer to the `tests/README.md` file.
